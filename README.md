# SC_1015_Data_Science
## Introduction
This is our (A132 Team 6) mini-project for SC1015 Data Science & Artificial Intelligence 2023.
The aim of our project is to create a model that predicts whether a movie will be successful based on certain variables. 
The dataset we will be using is [**TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

## Problem statement
1. Is it possible to predict the success of a movie based on pre and post production elements?
2. Which model is best to choose?
Definition of "success" - Generated revenue is higher than budget spent to produce the movie


## Model used
1. Linear Regression
2. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
## Conclusion


## What did we learn from this project?
1. Data Extraction & Cleaning
2. Data Visualisation
3. Uni & Multi Variate Analysis
4. Linear Regression Models
5. XGBoost Algorithm
6. Fine tuning the hyperparameters
7. cosine similarity scores from movie recommendation system
