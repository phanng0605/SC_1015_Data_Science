## Introduction
This is our (A132 Team 6) mini-project for SC1015 Data Science & Artificial Intelligence 2023.
The aim of our project is to create a model that predicts whether a movie will be successful based on certain variables. 
The dataset we will be using is [**TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
